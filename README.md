## Data Wrangling Functions

This is a repository of examples of packages::functions() I commonly use when wrangling education research data. I am building for myself, my team, and anyone else who comes across this site, to use as a reference for data cleaning projects.

Please visit the [WIKI](https://github.com/Cghlewis/data-wrangling-functions/wiki) for this repository to best utilize this resource.
