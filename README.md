## Data Wrangling Functions

This is a repository to house examples of packages::functions() I commonly use when wrangling education research data. My hope is that this repository will help me organize my data cleaning processes, and maybe it will be a helpful resource for others who come across it as well.

Please visit the [WIKI](https://github.com/Cghlewis/data-wrangling-functions/wiki) for this repository to best utilize this resource.
