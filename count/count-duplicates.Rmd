### Package: dplyr

---

#### Function: `count()`

---

**1\. Count how many duplicates we have per student in our data**

Review the data (d4)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("data.R")
d4

```

In this case, a student can be re-recruited back into our study each year. We now want to count how many years each student has been in our study.

In order to do this we can first group by our student id using `dplyr::group_by()` and then do a count.

```{r}

d4 %>%
  dplyr::group_by(stu_id) %>%
  dplyr::count()

```
