#### Function: `get_dupes()`

**1\. Review the duplicate student IDs in our data**

Review the data (d1)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("data.R")
d1

```

I can see that I have one "stu_id" that is duplicated in my data. In this case, I only expect to have one row per student id so I would need to make a plan for how to remove duplicate data.

```{r}

d1 %>% 
  janitor::get_dupes(stu_id)

```
