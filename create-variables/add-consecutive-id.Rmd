### Package: dplyr

#### Function: `consecutive_id()`

---


**1\. Assign an ID for each combination of two variables**

Review the data (d10)

```{r, echo = FALSE}

source("data.R")
d10

```

I want to create a new variable `video_id` that assigns an ID value for each unique date within each `tch_id` group. I also want those numbers to be order chronologically.

In order to do this, I first group by `tch_id`, then order dates chronologically, and then use `dplyr::consecutive_id()` to creat a unique identifier that increments every time a variable changes.

Last I make sure to `ungroup()` our data.

```{r}

d10 %>%
  dplyr::group_by(tch_id) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(date) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(video_id = dplyr::consecutive_id(date)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()

```
