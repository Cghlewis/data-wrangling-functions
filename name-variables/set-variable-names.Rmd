### Package: purrr

---

#### Function: `set_names()`

---

**1\. Set all variable names.**

Review the data (d7)

* Note: In this example you had a file, such as a csv file, with no variable names. You'll see that when you read the file in, R assigned variable names of X1, X2 and X3 in this instance.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("data.R")
d7

```

You can review the variable names using `base::names()`.

```{r}

names(d7)

```


Add variable names

* Note: Quotes are required around variable names and the number of variable names given must be equal to the number of variables in the data frame.

```{r}

d7 %>% purrr::set_names("id", "grade", "test1")

```
