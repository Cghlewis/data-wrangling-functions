### Package: dplyr

---

#### Function: `select()`

---

**1\. Select `school name` and `Var1` and rename them**

Review the data (d9)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("data.R")
d9

```


Select `school name` and `Var1` and rename them in the select statement.

* Note: The formula is the same as `dplyr::rename()`, *new value=old value*

```{r}

d9 %>%
  dplyr::select(school_name = `school name`, enrollment = `Var1`)

```
