### Package: dplyr

---

#### Function: `rename()`

---

**1\. Change the name of Var2**

Review the data (d1)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("data.R")
d1

```

Change "Var2" to "grade"

* Note: Quotes are not required around variable names. If your variable names have spaces in them, you will need to put backticks around the variable name (ex: \`Var 2\`)

```{r}

d1 %>% 
  dplyr::rename(grade = Var2)

```

If you wanted to change names of more than one variable you can just keep adding more variables.

```{r}

d1 %>% 
  dplyr::rename(grade = Var2, score = Var3)

```

### Package: dplyr

---

#### Function: `select()`

---

**1\. Rename variables when selecting them**

Review the data (d9)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("data.R")
d9

```


Select "school name" and "Var1" and rename them in the select statement.

* Note: The formula is the same as `dplyr::rename()`, *new value=old value*

```{r}

d9 %>%
  dplyr::select(school_name = `school name`, enrollment = `Var1`)

```
